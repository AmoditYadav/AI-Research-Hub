This application is composed of two specialized AI agents accessible through a unified Streamlit interface:

### 1. The Talent Scout Agent
-   **Objective:** Find potential candidates on LinkedIn based on specific job criteria.
-   **Workflow:**
    -   Dynamically generates targeted Google search queries (`site:linkedin.com/in/...`).
    -   Executes searches to find public profiles.
    -   Formats the results into a clean, readable report with profile links.

### 2. The Company Analyst Agent
-   **Objective:** Provide a full-spectrum intelligence report on any given company.

        -   **General News:** Developments, funding, partnerships, acquisitions.
        -   **Public Perception:** Controversies, criticisms, lawsuits, and layoffs.
        -   **Employee Sentiment:** Glassdoor reviews, ratings, pros, and cons.
